\nCONDITIONAL SEARCH [ECh]  \nThe Conditional Search ROM command operates similarly to the Search ROM command except that only those \ndevices, which fulfill certain conditions (CSR = 1), will participate in the searchThis function provides an efficient \nmeans for the bus master to identify devices on a multidrop system that have to signal an important eventAfter \neach pass of the conditional search that successfully determined the 64-bit ROM code for a specific device on the \nmultidrop bus, that particular device can be individually accessed as if a Match ROM had been issued, since all other devices will have dropped out of the search process and will be waiting for a reset pulseThe DS28E04-100 \nresponds to the conditional search if the CSR signal is activeSee the description of the registers at addresses 0223h to 0225h and Figure 7 for more details \n \nSKIP ROM [CCh]  \nThis command can save time in a single-drop bus system by allowing the bus master to access the memory functions without providing the 64-bit ROM codeI f more than one slave is present on the bus and, for example, a \nRead command is issued following the Skip ROM command, data collision occurs on the bus as multiple slaves transmit simultaneously (open-drain pulldowns produce a wired-AND result) \n \nRESUME [A 5h] \nTo maximize the data throughput in a multidrop environment, the Resume function is availableThis function checks the status of the RC bit and, if it is set, directly transfers control to the Memory functions, similar to a Skip \nROM commandThe only w ay to set the RC bit is through successfully executing the Match ROM, Search ROM, or \nOverdrive Match ROM commandOnce the RC bit is set, the device can repeatedly be accessed through the \nResume Command functionAccessing another device on the bus clears the RC bit, preventing two or more \ndevices from simultaneously responding to the Resume Command function \n \nOVERDRIVE SKIP ROM [3C h] \nOn a single-drop bus this command can save time by allowing the bus master to access the memory functions \nwithout providing the 64-bit ROM codeUnlike the normal Skip ROM command, the Overdrive Skip ROM sets the \nDS28E04-100 in the Overdrive mode (OD = 1)All communication following this command has to occur at \nOverdrive speed until a reset pulse of minimum 480\u00b5s duration
